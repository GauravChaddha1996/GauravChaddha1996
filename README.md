## Hi, I'm Gaurav 👋 
<img align="left" width="256" height="286" src="https://octodex.github.com/images/manufacturetocat.png">

I'm a Software Engineer II with 4 years of work experience, currently working at **Zomato**. I'm passionate about **Android**, **Kotlin**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Android Architecture components** and discussions around them. Some technologies that I dabble around for fun are **Golang**, **Redis** and **MySql**.

If you like to discuss Android, Kotlin, or perhaps rock music, drums or follow the football leagues around the world, find me around the web 🌎:
